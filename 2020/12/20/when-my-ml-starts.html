<h2 id="an-exciting-book">An exciting book</h2>

<p>In late 2020 I came across <em>Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD</em> by Jeremy Howard &amp; Sylvain Gugger and I was directly inspired and excited to dive into deep learning. Deep Learning, Machine Learning, AI and all the other terms of artifical intelligence had been very unclear to me - even though I’d been working for many years as a software developer. But with this book I got the feeling that the door to this domain is now opened to me. Opened by authors with long lasting experience in coding and teaching AI.</p>

<h2 id="my-coding-environment">My coding environment</h2>

<p>Following the book coding should take place in Jupyter Notebooks. After looking around for the different ways to get own Jupyter Notebooks running I decided to start with Google Colab for my Notebooks. Although there are some issues to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Colab Notebooks differ from the typical Jupyiter Notebook GUI</li>
  <li>Google doesn’t garantee access to GPUs (which is highly recommended when training your models). So you can run temporarily into performance problems.</li>
  <li>The Colab platform doesn’t support Voila, which will be used for publishing purposes</li>
</ol>

<p>From the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">books website</a> you can start any of the books chapters (the book itself is written in Jupyter Notebooks). From there you can copy or create new Notebooks and store them in Google Drive. The only prerequisite is a Google Account. That’s all.</p>

<p>From this point you can start adding and running your own (or copied) code and text blocks in your notebooks.</p>

  <p>When rebuilding the first samples from the book I had to add following imports:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from fastai.vision.widgets import widgets, PILImage
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>With this setting I was able to run the first prepared samples (image classifier and others) coming with the book.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-learned-until-now">What I’ve learned until now</h2>

<p>Each chapter of the book ends with a questionnaire which helps you checking your learning progress.</p>

<p>I learned</p>

<ul>
  <li>about the main areas of deep learning</li>
  <li>a brief historical survey (from the first artificial neurons to <strong>neuronal networks</strong>)</li>
  <li><strong>machine learning</strong> as another way (other than writing a program) to let computers do their task - by learning from their experience (= <strong>training</strong>)</li>
  <li>how training works</li>
  <li>models create <strong>predictions</strong> coming from input data</li>
  <li>different types of models like <strong>classification</strong> and <strong>regression</strong></li>
  <li>the meaning of input data and its division into different data sets like a <strong>training set</strong> used as training input, <strong>validation set</strong> (or development set) to measure the accuracy of a model and optional a separate <strong>test set</strong> to test a model with never seen data</li>
  <li>a lot new terms like <strong>epoch</strong>, <strong>metric</strong>, <strong>loss</strong>, <strong>overfitting</strong> …</li>
  <li>the use of <strong>pretrained models</strong> (and <strong>fine-tuning</strong>)</li>
</ul>
