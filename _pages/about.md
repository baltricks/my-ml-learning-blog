Hi, 

my name is Heike and I am a full stack software developer.

I studied computer science in Kiel, Germany and made my degree in the 90's. Since that time I worked as a developer in several companies. I touched the areas of logistics, consulting, telecommunication, medicine and currently meteorology.

I started my professional life with coding in C and C++. Then I changed to Java and in the last 2 years also to JavaScript.

Today I am responsible for Desktop Applications written in Java/JavaFX and Backend and Frontend Systems running with Node.js, Express and VueJS.

Since I became a mum (many years ago) I am working part time. I am a fan of life long learning and just started with machine learning and Python in my free time.
