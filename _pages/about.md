Hi, 

my name is Heike and I am a full stack software developer.

I studied computer science in Kiel, Germany and made my degree in the 90's. Since that time I mainly worked as a developer in several companies. I touched the areas of logistics, consulting, telecommunication, medicine and currently meteorology.

I started my professional life with coding in C and C++. Then I changed to Java and in the last 2 years also to JavaScript.

Today I am responsible for Desktop Applications written in Java/JavaFX and Backend and Frontend Systems running with Node.js, Express and VueJS.

As a mum I am working part time. In my free time I just started with machine learning and Python.
