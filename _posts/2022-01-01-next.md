# Drivetrain Approach
* Defined objective (What outcome am I trying to achieve?)
* Levers (What actions can I take? What inputs can we control?)
* Data (What inputs can I collect?)
* Models (How the levers influence the objective)

# Other Notes from Chapter 2
- one way to solve a particular problem with deep learning may or may not work with similiar looking problems
- for good results it's necessary to understand the constraints and capabilities of deep learning (don't over- or underestimate them)
- start many small projects, do them end-to-end - that lets the experience grow
