            "content": "Why do I write this blog? . As a developer I often feel how important it is . to stay focused on my (or my companies) goals | to frequently recap what I’ve done and how succesful it was | to see and remember the progress and not only what’s missing | and to keep the balance between diving deeply into things on one side and reacting to upcoming needs on the other side | . So a great part of this work is just thinking and making decisions. And that’s one reason to write this blog: It helps me to keep myself on this road. . And another important reason is my hope that this blog will one day help others on their way. Sharing content makes learning and development available for everybody. I benefit from this since years. . A GitHub Page for my blog . To keep things easy I decided to use GitHub Pages for this blog. I created a new git repository on GitHub and choose the main branch as page source and the cayman theme as Jekyll theme. All this can be done in the Settings / Github Pages section of the repository. . In this repository I created a directory structure for my future posts and made my adaptations in the index.md (as the home page of the blog) and _config.yml (the theme configuration). For layout customization I copied the _layouts/default.html from the origin theme repository into my repository and made my (minor) changes. . So I could create my first post (*.md) and reference it in my home page of the blog (index.md). The posts are written in the markdown syntax of the GitHub platform. You can find a short markdown guide here. . When I began to fill my first post with content I changed my procedure. Before that moment I did all editing via browser in the GitHub web site. But then I changed to my local computer: I used my Git Bash to clone the repository and made my editing locally with Visual Studio Code. There is a very nice extension called Markdown All in One which helps you writing pages in the markdown syntax. Now - when ready for publishing - I only have to push my content to the origin repository. The page updates automatically. .",

            "title": "When my ML learning starts",
            "content": "An exciting book . In late 2020 I came across Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD by Jeremy Howard (@jeremyphoward) &amp; Sylvain Gugger (@GuggerSylvain) and I was directly inspired and excited to dive into deep learning. Deep Learning, Machine Learning, AI and all the other terms of artifical intelligence had been very unclear to me - even though I’d been working for many years as a software developer. But with this book I got the feeling that the door to this domain is now opened to me. Opened by authors with long lasting experience in coding and teaching AI. . My coding environment . Following the book coding should take place in Jupyter Notebooks. After looking around for the different ways to get own Jupyter Notebooks running I decided to start with Google Colab for my Notebooks. Although there are some issues to keep in mind: . Colab Notebooks differ from the typical Jupyiter Notebook GUI | Google doesn’t garantee access to GPUs (which is highly recommended when training your models). So you can run temporarily into performance problems. | The Colab platform doesn’t support Voila, which will be used for publishing purposes | From the books website you can start any of the books chapters (the book itself is written in Jupyter Notebooks). From there you can copy or create new Notebooks and store them in Google Drive. The only prerequisite is a Google Account. That’s all. . From this point you can start adding and running your own (or copied) code and text blocks in your notebooks. . When rebuilding the first samples from the book I had to add following imports: . from fastai.vision.widgets import widgets, PILImage . With this setting I was able to run the first prepared samples (image classifier and others) coming with the book. . What I’ve learned until now . Each chapter of the book ends with a questionnaire which helps you checking your learning progress. . I enjoy it. It’s very useful. . Here are some topics: . the main areas of deep learning | a brief historical survey (from the first artificial neurons to neuronal networks) | machine learning as another way (other than writing a program) to let computers do their task - by learning from their experience (= training) | a first idea how training works | predictions coming from input data | different types of models like classification and regression | the meaning of input data and its division into different data sets like a training set used as training input, validation set (or development set) to measure the accuracy of a model and optional a separate test set to test a model with never seen data | a lot new terms like epoch, metric, loss, overfitting … | the use of pretrained models (and fine-tuning) | .",

            "title": "An Example Markdown Post",
            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
